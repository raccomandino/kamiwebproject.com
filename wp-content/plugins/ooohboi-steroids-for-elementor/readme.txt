Boost your Elementor with some fresh and yet innovative options.

== Description ==

An awesome set of tools, options and settings that expand Elementor defaults. Instead of creating new Elementor Widgets, these act like an upgrade of existing options or the self-standing panels thing. 

== What is new? ==

= Fix for the disappearing 'Glider' slider =

- Add/remove/update preview image
- Export and Import with preview
- Works with any 3rd party plugin
- Cross-domain friendly
- WP Admin integration
- Bulk-export and bulk-import support
- Keep template name on export

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Upgrade Notice ==

2.1.0 - Beware of changes to the language file!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use OoohBoi Steroids? =

It depends on the widgets that you are editing. For example, if you are about to style Heading widget or Text Editor widget, HARAKIRI options will show up.
All the POOPART options can be found under "Advanced" tab, POOPART panel.
Rest assured, you won't miss them because there will always be an eye-catching icon next to the set of options (or the panel title).

= Do I need Elementor PRO with this add-on? =

No, you don't. It'll work with both free version of Elementor and Elementor PRO.
